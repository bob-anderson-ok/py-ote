Introduction
============

Here is a sample main plot from **pyote**:


.. figure:: images/main-plot.png
   :scale: 60%
   :align: center

   Just a sample to whet your appetite

Chapter 1
---------

There's not much to see yet, but I'll get working on this once
I get back from the Canada trip.

Second paragraph starts now ...

.. figure:: images/error-bar-test-on-windows.R-D.png
   :align: center

   Error bar analysis is a central capability of **pyote**

And the code to get all this wonderfulness started is ::

   from pyoteapp import pyote
   pyote.main()

And more will follow shortly.
